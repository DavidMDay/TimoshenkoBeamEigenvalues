# TimoshenkoBeamEigenvalues
Software for the verification of Timoshenko beam finite elements
by computing their modes and mode shapes.  The theory is based on the
paper Dynamics of transversely vibrating beams using four engineering
theories by Seon M. Han and Haym Benaroya and Timothy Wei published in
the Journal of Sound and Vibration, 2225 (5), 1999, pp. 935-988.

TODO: update src, document prerequisites from Han and Benaroya
about intent, usage, notation
